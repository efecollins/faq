## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass

### What I learned

Okay, here it is again, at first I thought the project was easy and I targeted finishing this within days but here I am completing this in weeks. 

There are a lot of things I have learnt now. Some of them are;
- Use sizes that are okay for your viewport.
- Although I don't like the idea. It's cool to build mobile first because there won't be much stress when checking your sizes again.


### Continued development

- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### Useful resources

- [Flavio Copes](https://www.flaviocopes.com) - This helped me for Flexbox and Grids. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
